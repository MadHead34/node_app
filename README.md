# node_app

## Mission 5 Backend

The backend folder for Mission 5 you must create a root folder first and then have the Node-App folder separated with the metropropertyclient folder as they perform different
actions. You will have the dockerfile for the the node_app folder as well so you can make build for the node_app directory in the docker-compose.yaml file.
